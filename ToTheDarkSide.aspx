        Astronomers have sent satellites and probes to the moon to observe the dark side.  They believe that the shadows prevent certain substances, such as water, from evaporating and escaping into space.  
One lunar mission in 2009, involving the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCOSS), was able to detect and confirm the presence of water on the moon.  The LCOSS crashed into the moon, causing moon rock and other debris to fly outward into space.  Then LRO analyzed the debris and found evidence of water ice that existed at the moon’s south pole, the location of the testing site.
On the dark side, there are permanently shaded regions where light never reaches the surface.  In order to take pictures of these areas, astronomers have used light-reflecting hydrogen atoms that are floating around in space to cast light on these areas; this light is called lyman alpha emission, which is present in very small wavelengths.  
LRO is also being used to map out the dark side of the moon using a laser ranging tool to create a topographical map of the dark side of the moon.  It also has tools to monitor the ranging temperatures over the course of a year that occur on the surface on the dark side.

        In addition to researching the dark side of the moon, LRO has discovered the crash site of Lunar Orbiter 2 that was intentionally crashed in 1967 after going out of radio range.  The lunar orbiter’s function was to document areas fit for the future Apollo landing missions.  Until now, astronomers hadn’t known were the crash site was.  But with the help of LRO, astronomers have been able to solve this problem, and with that, raise more questions as to what exists on the “Dark Side”.
