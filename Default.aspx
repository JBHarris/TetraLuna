    <h3>Have you ever wondered what is on the "Dark Side" of the 
moon?</h3>
    <p>
        Astronomers have been fascinated for decades with what 
secrets the shadows might contain. Scientists estimate that the dark side of 
the moon hasn't seen sunlight for more than two billion years.
    </p>

    The dark side of the moon is extremely different from its near side counterpart. The near side, which is what we can see, is full of scars from being hit by meteors (rocks that float through space); craters within craters cover the surface, creating a landscape completely different from our own. The near side has vast maria (plural, mar-ee-ya), Latin for "seas”, which make up the lunar landscape, creating a large, bowl-like surface. But these "seas" don't contain water like the oceans on our own planet; they are full of hills and valleys, which have basaltic lava flows that ooze across the surface. These lava flows are why the maria are called what they are. Early astronomers believed these flows to. be "lunar water", hence the name mare (singular).

    On the other hand, the dark side is a much more mysterious and has totally different scenery than the side of the moon that we all know and love.
